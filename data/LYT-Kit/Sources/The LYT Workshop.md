# The LYT Workshop
Imagine having 1,000 of your favorite ideas all in one place. Your favorite concepts, quotes, and memories finally all connected in one living, powerful system.

Think of this as your **Ideaverse**—and it's what you will create during the workshop.

In the "Linking Your Thinking" (LYT) Workshop you will create your custom—and future-proof—PKM system. PKM stands for Personal Knowledge Management. 

The LYT Workshop is an online workshop that will teach, train, and support you in building a PKM system you can trust.

You will learn a proven method to:

- Do your best thinking, more often
- Reliably organize your knowledge
- Unlock your unique perspective
- Generate more insights

And as a side benefit you will:

- Rediscover the joy of thinking.

The workshop is also a community-driven learning experience. Learning with your fellow students is the best way to accelerate your own efforts. 

Linking Your Thinking is all about making a change in your relationship with knowledge.

Build the place for your thoughts that you've always wanted.
