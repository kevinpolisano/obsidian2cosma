# Habits MOC - Gather Phase
The first non-linear phase of MOCs is where you *assemble, collect, gather, curate, incubate* your ideas. This is where you put related stuff on a new digital workbench.

Imagine having a warehouse of limitless workbenches, and for each workbench you curate the notes placed on it. Whenever you feel you need to get a handle on a bunch of notes on `Subject XYZ`,  just throw them all onto a new workbench—i.e. place their links into a new MOC note titled `Subject XYZ MOC`.

I have only "gathered" the links. They are not organized yet. That happens in the next phase:
