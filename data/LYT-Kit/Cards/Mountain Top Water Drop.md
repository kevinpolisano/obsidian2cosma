# Mountain Top Water Drop
The concept was delivered by Edward James Olmos in Joaquin Phoenix's quasi-spoof movie "I'm Here". 

Although the movie was hard to watch and not enjoyable, I appreciated that the journey of the Mountain Top Water Drop was essentially the through line of the film. It that sense, it's actually quite poetic.

> That's me, that's you. Drops of water. And you're on top of the mountain of success. But one day you start sliding down the mountain and you think, "wait a minute. I'm a mountaintop water drop. I don't belong in this valley, in this river, This low, dark ocean with all these drops of water." Yeah?.  And you feel confused. Then one day it gets hot And you slowly evaporate in the air. Way up... higher than any mountaintop, All the way to the heavens. Then you understand that it was at your lowest that you were closest to God. Because life's a journey that goes around and around And the end is closest to the beginning. So it's change you need, Relish the journey. Be a drop of running water. Obey those invisible pulls on your soul... Gravity, evaporation, love, Creativity. It's... in the darkest moments Is when the cracks allow The inner light to come out. But the spotlights... Don't let you see the inner light.

### A daily cycle
One way to look at this metaphor is on a daily cycle.

A day's work takes you to the river, lake, or ocean. Sleep evaporates you into the clouds. Waking up puts you back as a [[Mountain Top Water Drop]]. ^7248b9

The Musician "Tha Playah" used this speech in his track "On The Edge".
