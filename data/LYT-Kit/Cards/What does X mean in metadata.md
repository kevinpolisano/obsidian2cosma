# What does X mean in metadata
Although "X" is not a word, it can quickly be intuited. 

X is a connection. An intersection. X is intentionally fuzzy. We know it's relevant or related but sometimes it's too early and delicate to start defining everything. Using X is a quick placeholder. Ideally, some of the X's get worked into the body of the note.

In a play: "What is X if not everything? Doth X not mark the spot?"
