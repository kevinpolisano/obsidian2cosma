# Newton's Laws of Motion
In classical mechanics, Newton's laws of motion are three laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. The first law states that an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless it is acted upon by an external force.

## Newton's 1st Law of Motion
"Law of Inertia"

The first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by a [net external force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_force "Net force"). Mathematically, this is equivalent to saying that if the net force on an object is zero, then the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") of the object is constant.

## Newton's 2nd Law of Motion
The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force.

## Newton's 3rd Law of Motion
The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction:
