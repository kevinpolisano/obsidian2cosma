# Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge
Information is everywhere. 

> It is in a book / it is in a nook / it's absolutely everywhere you look. 

Information is all around us. 

Once we have a relationship with any bit of information—consciously or subconsciously—that information becomes knowledge.

Said another way: *Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge.*

With enough knowledge, experience, and "connecting-the-dots" that comes from living; we form patterns of insights, heuristics, and helpful models of the world. The better we get, the more complex patterns we are able to chunk into bite size bits that we can act upon. 

"Pattern recognition" alone doesn’t make us wise, but it gets us closer to wisdom. It opens the door to acting with more of that cumulative **umami** we might call wisdom.

All from making sense—over time—of countless bits of information.
