# Wim Hof
I'm a big fan of the adventurous and ecclectic Iceman. Here's an essay: [[Exploring Wim Hof's Breath Manipulation (kit)]].

### Wiki
> **Wim Hof** (born 20 April 1959), also known as The Iceman, is a Dutch motivational speaker and extreme athlete noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures. He has set Guinness World Records for swimming under ice and prolonged full-body contact with ice, and previously held the record for a barefoot half marathon on ice and snow. He attributes these feats to his Wim Hof Method (WHM), a combination of frequent cold exposure, breathing techniques, yoga and meditation. Hof has been the subject of several medical assessments and a book written by investigative journalist Scott Carney.
