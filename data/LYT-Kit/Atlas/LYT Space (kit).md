# LYT Space 🔆 (kit)
When you add links to folder-based PKM, you need MOCs. It's actually quite simple. For every space you have in your life, you just deploy the MAPS folder structure:

- **M**OCs
- **A**reas
- **P**rojects
- **S**upport notes

## MOCs

**What is the mission of LYT?**
Broadly speaking, the mission of LYT is to empower and enfranchise large numbers of people to think critically and creatively; fluidly and flexibly; connectively and joyfully—in a way that accumulates in value for them over time.
 
This will lead to:

1. More thinking, better thinking
2. The ability to stay psychologically grounded in a turbulent world
3. More unique and valuable contributions
